    "### [35 points] Problem 1: Malaria Parasite Problems\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Malaria parasites are very good at evading the immune system. Each parasite's genome has 60 different versions of a key immune evasion gene, so that when you get malaria, instead of simply getting sick and then getting better, the parasite switches among its 60 genes, sequentially, thereby changing its camouflage over and over and over. This is one of the reasons that malaria is still a huge problem today: you never develop a really strong immunity to the overall parasite population, due to its huge genetic diversity. You can read more about this [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/networks-untangle-malarias-deadly-shuffle-20151015/) if you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are concerned with helping out lab scientists in desigining and evaluating their genetic sequencing experiments which target _var_ genes. The setup is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each parasite has a repertoire of 60 different \"var\" genes.\n",
    "* A process called PCR is applied to a parasite genome. If PCR is successful, we get the sequence of one of the var genes, drawn at random from the repertoire of 60. However, PCR might not be successful at all, in which case we get nothing. Let the probability that a PCR attempt fails be equal to $f$. \n",
    "* In other words, with probability $f$, PCR yields nothing. With probability $1-f$, PCR produces a var gene sequence, and this sequence is chosen uniformly at random from among the total 60 var genes. \n",
    "* Importantly, PCR _does not deplete the DNA in the sample_, meaning that if one repeats the PCR process, the stochastic process described above takes place again, independently of the outcome of the previous PCR.\n",
    "* In other words, a repeated PCR might fail, or it might succeed. And, if it succeeds, the same gene might be sequenced _or_ a different one of the 60 genes might be sequenced.\n",
    "* To be clear: repeating PCR might sample a previously sampled gene, or it might sample another one of the 60. Then again, any individual PCR fails with probability $f$."
