Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "Dan, Kyle, and Sofie have been playing board games for ages. Among the games they play a lot are Miniopoly and a similar game with slightly tweaked rules called **Fakeiopoly!**  Being Data-Nerds, they like to record the details of each game they play for future analysis.  Since the games are similar, they store the results for Miniopoly and Fakeiopoly in the same database.  Unfortunately, their data has been corrupted!  The only data that survived are the states (i.e. square numbers) they were on after each of the first 20 turns as well a the amount of cash they had on hand after each of the first 20 turns. This information is stored in the columns **S1**-**S20** and **C1**-**C20** in the following DataFrame. "

As part of your solution you should describe in detail how you based your predictions.  A solution with high accuracy and no justification of you approach may receive a low score, while a solution with mediocre accuracy and good justification may receive a high score.  What aspects of the data lead you to believe that your approach might be successful? Supporting evidence might include graphical summaries of the data and extensive description of trial and error. "
