    "This assignment is due on Moodle by **5pm on Friday April 20th**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/dblarremore/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. "

Let $X$ be the random variable describing the age of a site visitor and suppose that the population mean for $X$ is $\\mu$. In particular, Stevey wants to see if the data suggests that the mean age of their customers is under 30 years old.   He decides to perform the test with a null hypothesis of $H_0: \\bar{x} = 30$. "
