    "This assignment is due on Moodle by **5pm on Friday April 20th**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/dblarremore/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. "

    "One way that scientists misuse p-values is that they believe that p-values can tell the probability that a result occurred by chance. P-values only tells you something about the probability of seeing your results given a particular hypothetical explanation. Another way that scientists misuse p-values is that they think that p-values measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or that the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone. They also misuse it in the sense that they think that a p-values can tell you the size of an effect, the strength of the evidence or the importance of a resulst. Finally, scientists misue p-values by failing to adjust them for cherry picking, multiple testing, post-data subgroups and other biasing selection effects. Some suggestions to use them properly would be to move toward a greater acceptance of uncertainty and embracing of variation. Another suggestion was to select a definition of p-values that nonstatisticians can understand.\n"

In this exercise we will focus on the idea of testing hypotheses on subsets of a single data set.  \n",

    "Johnny Nefarious has landed his first data science internship at an online marketing firm.  His primary summer project has been to design and test a new email advertisement for his company's best-selling product. To test his advertisement his supervisors have allowed him to send his ad to 4 targeted customer groups of 50 people every day for a month. \n",

The company's standard email advertisement has a CTR of $0.05$.  Johnny is hoping to land a permanent position at the company when he graduates, so he's **really** motivated to show his supervisors that the CTR of his email advertisement is a (statistically) significant improvement over their previous ad. \n",
